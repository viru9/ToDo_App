This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`
install the dependencies

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run-script build`
